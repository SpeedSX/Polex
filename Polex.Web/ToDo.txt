- is it possible to remove duplication of ajax handling on login page and angularjs app? 
  maybe creating a separate angularjs app for login can fix that?
- remove _libconfig.js and blockui
- create bower.json and get more deps from bower?
- check TenantSelection
- delete user
- change user password
- use angular-moment to format dates
- preparing of release version (minification, templateCache etc.)
- refactor $confirm and $error to avoid code duplication, add icons
- in-place validation results http://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2014/08/angularjs-meet-aspnet-server-validation.html
- use ui-grid
- abp.jtable.js - needed?
